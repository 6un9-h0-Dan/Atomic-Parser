## Python Red Canary Atomic Yaml Parser

This script will recursivly loop through the Atomic yamls and then print out attack behavior and detection/prevention
rules based the command executors observed.   

To run this script you'll need to follow the below steps in a terminal window:   

1. clone the Red Canary Atomic Red Team git repo into this project
  * `git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.git`

2. Run the script
  * `python go.py`


Note: I am not printing out the manual executor test cases but you can easily add that :)
